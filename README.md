# Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)

## What this project does:
LIRI is a node.js command line interface application that showcases the use of request.js and many other javascript libraries, in order to make calls to an endpoint API and display data inside the command line.

## Why this is useful:
Using node.js and the command line is an excellent stepping-stone into the world of server-side and general back-end programming. In addition to using node.js, it also uses many other node packages and javascript libraries, such as Inquirer for the main user interface, Moment.js to help parse dates, request to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints, the File System node module to read from a text document, and environment variables to increase security.

## How to use: 
Simply clone this repository onto your computer, and run the liri.js file using node.js!
